# Linux_Device_Drivers
I'm trying to learn how to program Linux Device Drivers, operate with the Linux Device Tree, and gain an understanding of embedded communication protocols (I2C, SPI, UART, etc.). As part of this, I've got a Raspberry Pi and some off the shelf electronics components that I can use with a breadboard. My plan is to write drivers for these circuits as well as test code.

Each folder will be named and numbered with an individual driver, or group of drivers depending on the component.
